# Customer-Sales-Dashboard
This project showcases my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Power BI.

In this project, I utilized Power Query to clean and transform raw data into a format that can be easily analyzed. I also created a date table and measures using DAX functions. For those who are not familiar with DAX functions, they are formulas that help you create custom calculations for your data model in Power BI.

To visualize the data, I created cards that display currency, total sales last month, total sales amount, and slices to filter users based on sales territory and currency. Additionally, I used a map to view the total product amount worldwide and a table to view sales amount percentages. For more detailed insights, I created bar charts to view total sales amounts per month.

One of the most important features of this dashboard is the use of bookmarks. Bookmarks allow you to save the settings you've made to filters, slicers, and visuals on that page so that you can easily return to them later.

Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to turn complex data into actionable insights through effective visualization techniques.
